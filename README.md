# Flow Spring - a VR Breathing Game for Stress relief

This repository contains the source code for the **Final Year Project: VR Breathing Intervention**, which explores how immersive virtual reality experiences can support guided breathing exercises through synchronized visual and audio feedback.

The project investigates VR as an experiential medium for relaxation and stress regulation, with an emphasis on interaction design and user engagement rather than clinical treatment.

## Project Overview

The VR breathing intervention guides users through paced breathing within an immersive virtual environment. Breathing rhythms are communicated using visual cues and environmental changes, accompanied by audio narration to support calm and consistent inhalation and exhalation.

This project was developed as an academic prototype for evaluation and demonstration purposes.

## Repository Structure

- `Assets/` – Unity assets, scripts, and scenes  
- `Scripts/` – Breathing logic, interaction control, and audio/visual synchronization  
- `Scenes/` – Main VR breathing experience scenes  



## Usage

This repository is intended for:

- Academic review and assessment  
- Project demonstration  
- Reference for VR-based wellbeing and breathing experiences  

To Run

1. Download the latest release from the **Releases** section of this repository.
2. Install the provided APK file onto a Meta Quest 3 headset (via Meta Quest Developer Hub or ADB).
3. Put on the headset and launch the application from the App Library.
4. Follow the in-experience instructions to start the guided breathing session.



## Limitations

- This is a research and design prototype, not a medical or therapeutic product.  
- No physiological sensing (e.g., real-time breathing detection) is implemented.  
- User experience outcomes are exploratory and context-dependent.
